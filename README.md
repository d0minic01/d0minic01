Robin, NAF-DPM, DP-LinkNet, and Unet-br are deep learning-based binarization approaches I modified to compare their binarization performance. The binarization repository contains utility scripts to prepare datasets for each approach, ensuring compatibility with their respective required formats. The writer identification repository implements a writer identification and retrieval pipeline based on the method proposed by Christlein et al. [^1]. It also includes a quantitative evaluation to enable comparisons between the various approaches.
